      <h2 id="multi-pitch">Multi-Pitch and Big Wall Rope Soloing</h2>
      <p>
        When soloing a multi-pitch climb or big wall, the fundamental challenge is amplified: after each 
        pitch you lead, you have to descend or jug back up and haul gear, before continuing. Big wall rope 
        soloing (common on aid climbs in Yosemite, for example) is perhaps the most gear- and labor-intensive 
        form of rope solo. It demands strong systems for both lead belaying and rope management across multiple pitches.
      </p>

      <h3>General Process</h3>
      <p>
        Andy Kirkpatrick summarizes big wall soloing as "leading a pitch, then rappelling it, jumarring back up again, 
        and then hauling your bag up". In effect, every pitch you climb alone, you must do three times: once up on 
        lead, once down (cleaning gear), once up again (jugging back or climbing the next pitch). 
      </p>
      <p>
        This makes it slow – "there is perhaps no bigger test of skill", but also "no bigger reward" when you top 
        out knowing you did every inch alone.
      </p>

      <h3>Common Devices for Multi-Pitch Solo</h3>
      <p>
        Historically, dedicated solo devices shine in this domain. The now-discontinued Silent Partner (Rock Exotica) 
        was a favorite for free climbing solos on big walls – Pete Whittaker famously used a Silent Partner to 
        rope-solo free climb El Capitan in under 24 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        These devices offer very smooth feed and a dynamic catch (the Silent Partner uses a clove hitch on a 
        spinning drum that slips a bit to absorb energy). Other specialized devices included the Soloist and 
        Solo-Aid by Wren Industries.
      </p>
      <p>
        In modern times, many big wall soloists use a modified Petzl GriGri for lead belaying, or the Petzl Pro 
        Traxion (a beefier pulley) for aid rope solo.
      </p>

      <h3>Step-by-Step Example (Multi-Pitch, using a GriGri or similar)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>Pitch 1 – Ground Anchor</h4>
          <p>
            Start just as in the single-pitch scenario: build a solid multidirectional anchor at the base of the route. 
            Tie in the rope and set up your self-belay device on your harness. For multi-pitch aid climbs, soloists 
            often carry two ropes: the lead rope and a haul line. The lead rope is what you climb with and attach to 
            gear; the haul line is a static rope used to haul your gear bag (or to retreat/rap if needed).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Lead the Pitch</h4>
          <p>
            Climb the first pitch, feeding rope through your device and clipping gear as described earlier. On an aid 
            climb, you might "top-step" your aid ladders to clip the highest piece, then short-fix the rope occasionally. 
            Free climbing, you'd do it just as any lead but self-belayed.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's critical to manage rope drag – use extenders on gear if needed because you cannot have a partner 
            give/take slack in tricky sections; your rope must run freely. If the pitch traverses, be mindful that 
            you'll later have to rappel and prusik – so consider placing directionals or using twin ropes (advanced 
            tactic) to avoid dangerous pendulums when cleaning.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Anchor at Top of Pitch & Fix the Rope</h4>
          <p>
            Upon reaching the end of the pitch (say there's a belay ledge or bolts), secure yourself and build the next 
            anchor. Make it bombproof (you're trusting it while you rappel and jug). Now fix the lead rope to the anchor. 
            Usually, you'll tie the rope off to the anchor with a figure-8 knot or clove hitches on locking carabiners.
          </p>
          <p>
            You might also re-direct the rope through anchor bolts or rings. Essentially, you're creating a top-rope 
            setup on the pitch you just led. Many soloists tie off the rope in two places for redundancy (e.g. tie the 
            rope to two separate bolts). Double-check that the rope is truly fixed and secure. This fixed rope is what 
            will hold you when you descend and then ascend.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Prepare to Rappel</h4>
          <p>
            Remove your self-belay device from the rope (you're now anchored in directly at the belay). Set up your rappel 
            device on the fixed rope. Usually, you'll rappel the lead rope itself to clean the gear. Some climbers choose 
            to rappel on a second rope (the haul line) if it's already anchored, but that can complicate cleaning.
          </p>
          <p>
            A common method is to put a GriGri on the rope for descent, because you can easily stop to clean gear and also 
            it acts as a safety if you let go (or use an ATC with a prusik backup). Petzl notes that using a GriGri to 
            rappel/clean is "easier and safer" for the soloist. Attach your rappel device to the rope, test it (weight it 
            gently to ensure it's on right), then unclip from the anchor and begin rappelling the pitch.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Rappel and Clean</h4>
          <p>
            Descend the pitch you just led, and clean your gear on the way down. If it's a straight up-and-down pitch, 
            this is straightforward – each piece you placed, you remove and rack as you come to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            If there were traversing sections or overhangs, you might have to do a controlled swing or use your ascenders 
            to reposition. For example, if the pitch traversed significantly, once you clean the lower pieces you could 
            pendulum; to avoid that, you can leave a piece for last and lower out from it using a sling (common in aid: 
            leave a piece, attach a sling, unclip rope and let yourself swing under it gently).
          </p>
          <p>
            This part requires creativity and care to avoid big uncontrolled swings or stuck ropes. The American Alpine 
            Club's accident reports have noted rope soloists needing to make "intermediate belays" or dealing with ropes 
            getting stuck during cleaning – so plan your placements with cleaning in mind. If things get really tricky, 
            you can always jug back up a bit to adjust (hence having ascenders handy).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>At the Bottom Anchor Again</h4>
          <p>
            Now you're back at the starting point (for pitch 1, that's the ground). You should have all your gear recovered 
            except perhaps the top anchor pieces which remain. Now jumar (ascend) back up the fixed rope to your high point. 
            You attach ascenders (or use one ascender and your GriGri in "self-jug" mode) on the rope and climb the rope itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the third time covering the terrain. Ascending 30–50m of rope with jumars and a heavy pack is physically 
            tiring – part of why rope soloing is so strenuous. Upon reaching the top again, you're back at your high anchor, 
            ready to lead the next pitch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Haul up any pack or haul bag using a pulley system (if you have a haul line, you'd pull it up; if not, you might 
            have dragged it while jugging or left it clipped to your harness). Big wall soloists often haul a separate bag 
            with water, food, bivy gear – one reason they prefer static haul lines to save their lead rope from shredding 
            under haul weight.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Repeat for the Next Pitch</h4>
          <p>
            Now set up for leading pitch 2. Often you can re-use the rope continuous from pitch 1: you'll untie it from the 
            now-below anchor and stack it, then lead upward on the same rope. Some soloists carry an extra rope to fix one 
            pitch while leading on another (leapfrogging ropes), but that's advanced.
          </p>
          <p>
            Generally, you climb the next pitch with the same procedure: anchor, self-belay, climb, fix, rappel, clean, ascend. 
            One thing to note is you should try to make each belay anchor multi-directional and ready for upward pull before 
            you start the next lead. If you only placed downward-oriented pieces at the anchor, the moment you start leading 
            above it, a fall will yank those pieces upward potentially dislodging them.
          </p>

      <h3>Special Considerations for Multi-Pitch</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Device Considerations:</strong> The device you use for self-belaying on lead must be absolutely reliable – 
          you're trusting it pitch after pitch, often on very long climbs. This is why many soloists loved the Silent Partner: 
          it has a strong track record of catching falls in any orientation (even upside down) and feeds with minimal fuss.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rope Management:</strong> On multi-pitch, rope management becomes complex. You may have an extra rope 
          (haul line) that needs to be managed to avoid knots. When soloing the famous Freerider on El Cap, Jorg Verhoeven 
          noted "the ropes got stuck" often, forcing him to improvise intermediate anchors. To mitigate this, stack your 
          rope in a rope bag at each belay.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hauling:</strong> If you have a heavy haul bag, each pitch after jugging up, you need to haul the bag. 
          Typically, you'll use a progress capture pulley (like a Pro Traxion or even Micro Traxion) at the anchor: attach 
          it, drop the haul line, and then either haul by pulling the rope or by "jumar hauling" (using your body weight 
          on ascenders).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rest and Strategy:</strong> Soloing multi-pitch, you have to manage fatigue. You might opt to fix a pitch 
          and actually rest (eat, sleep) before continuing, something rarely done with a partner on free climbs but common 
          in solo (you're on your own schedule).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Big Wall/Aid Solo vs Free Solo:</strong> On aid climbs, rope soloing is more common and in some ways easier 
          to manage because you're often hanging on gear (giving you hands free to tend ropes, tie knots, etc.). On free climbs, 
          you have to do everything on the fly while climbing free, which is more challenging – you can't hang out fiddling 
          with ropes too long or you'll fall.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Multi-Pitch Summary:</strong> Multi-pitch rope soloing is a slow but methodical process. Expect to climb, 
          rap, and jug every pitch. Redundancy and safety are paramount – double-check every knot and piece of gear. As one 
          climbing guide states: when you're alone, you must "be a good partner to yourself and double check" anchors, device 
          orientation, carabiners locked, etc.
