      <h2>Key Figures and Milestones in Big Wall History</h2>
      
      <p>
        Big wall climbing has a rich history, with climbers continuously pushing what's possible on the world's tallest cliffs. 
        This timeline highlights some of the most significant developments and pioneering ascents.

          <h3>Early Pioneers (1950s–60s)</h3>
          
          <div className="timeline-event">
            <h4>1957: First Grade VI Big Wall Ascent in Yosemite</h4>
            <p>
              Royal Robbins and teammates made one of the first Grade VI big wall ascents with the Northwest Face of Half Dome. 
              This established a new level of commitment and technical difficulty in American climbing.

            <h4>1958: First Ascent of The Nose, El Capitan</h4>
            <p>
              Warren Harding led a marathon 47-day first ascent of The Nose on El Capitan, employing siege tactics (fixing ropes, 
              using hundreds of pitons and bolts). This ascent captured worldwide attention for its scale and determination.

          <div className="timeline-event">
            <h4>1961: First Ascent of the Salathé Wall</h4>
            <p>
              Royal Robbins, along with Tom Frost and Chuck Pratt, established the Salathé Wall on El Capitan, climbing in a more 
              efficient and alpine style than earlier efforts.

          <div className="timeline-event">
            <h4>1964: North America Wall</h4>
            <p>
              Robbins continued to refine big wall techniques with the first ascent of the North America Wall on El Capitan, 
              firmly establishing Yosemite as the proving ground for big wall climbing.

          <div className="timeline-event">
            <h4>1960s: European Development</h4>
            <p>
              In Europe, climbers like Walter Bonatti were pioneering big walls on alpine peaks. Bonatti's solo of the Dru west face 
              in 1955 was an alpine big wall masterpiece that showed the potential for applying aid techniques in alpine environments.

            <h4>1970s: Clean Climbing Revolution</h4>
            <p>
              Led by Yvon Chouinard and others, climbers began transitioning from pitons to nuts and later cams, establishing "clean climbing" 
              ethics to minimize damage to the rock. By 1972, this revolution was in full swing.

            <h4>1976: Trango Tower</h4>
            <p>
              A British team including Joe Brown climbed the steep Trango Tower in Pakistan – among the first high-altitude big walls, 
              combining big wall techniques with expedition logistics.

            <h4>1978: Sea of Dreams</h4>
            <p>
              Charlie Porter's solo first ascent of Sea of Dreams on El Capitan pushed aid climbing difficulty to A5, establishing 
              the upper limit of aid climbing danger and technical challenge.

            <h4>1980s: Remote Walls</h4>
            <p>
              Adventurers like Doug Scott and Charlie Porter began exploring walls in remote places, including Baffin Island and Patagonia, 
              applying big wall techniques to virgin territory.

          <div className="timeline-event">
            <h4>1980s: Modern Portaledge</h4>
            <p>
              John Middendorf designed the first truly modern portaledge (the A5 ledge), making multi-day solos and weathering storms 
              more survivable, revolutionizing what was possible on big walls.

            <p>
              Middendorf and Xaver Bongard climbed the Great Trango Tower's east face, one of the longest big walls on Earth (1,340m), 
              in a ground-up epic that exemplified modern big wall expedition style.

          <div className="timeline-event">
            <h4>1988: Free Salathé</h4>
            <p>
              Todd Skinner and Paul Piana free-climbed the Salathé Wall on El Capitan at 5.13b, proving big walls held free climbing potential 
              and beginning the era of free climbing on routes established with aid.

            <p>
              Lynn Hill achieved a landmark with the first free ascent of The Nose on El Capitan (overnight, graded 5.14a) – a feat long 
              deemed impossible. Her famous remark, "It goes, boys," announced a new era where big walls could be climbed without artificial aid.

            <h4>1990s: Hard Aid Lines</h4>
            <p>
              While free climbing advanced, aid climbing continued to progress with ever more difficult "trade routes" on El Cap, like Jolly 
              Roger or WYDIWYG reaching A5 difficulty ratings with extremely committing sequences of marginal placements.

            <p>
              After years of effort, Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson free-climbed the Dawn Wall of El Capitan at 5.14d, the hardest big wall 
              free climb in the world. Their ascent, done in a single push over 19 days, brought big walls to mainstream media globally.

              Alex Honnold & Tommy Caldwell raced up the Nose in under 2 hours – a stunning application of simul-climbing and efficiency on a 
              route that originally took 47 days to establish.

              Big wall climbing has matured into a diverse activity, from multi-day "vertical camping" adventures that recreational climbers 
              enjoy on classic routes, to elite free climbs pushing human ability, to expedition big walls in remote corners of the globe 
              requiring self-sufficiency and creativity.
